## APP DEFINITION:
I would like to make an App that helps other to learn Jhipster and, at the same time, that becomes an interesting project that can grow over time with different parts. I had a name for my Spanish site and we can use it for now: raroraroraro.com (means weirdx3).

RARO is the combination of several sub-apps or parts: a dating site, a newspaper with a blog, a proposal and voting site and a bulletin board. Let’s start with a brief description of each part:

•	Dating site: A user can fill a profile detailing the activities or interest he has. He can follow other user with similar tastes, activities or sports, to join groups that meet together. A user, or group profile, can upload an Album with photographs. A profile can also receive messages and notifications.

•	Newspaper: The admin can manage the FrontPage of the site placing news that he considers interesting. This news can be general news, or specific ones about main interests or activities that are important for him or his gorup. A profile or a group can have a Blog, post news and users can comment those posts that would be grouped with tags and topics that are related with the interests and activities of the dating site.

•	Proposals: Think of a proposal as a general idea. A user thinks about something that wants to present to other users for consideration, so he fills a proposal. This proposal could be explained in a Post and it can be voted by other users, a group or the general visitor.

•	Bulletin Board: will be used to post offers and demands for things or services.

•	Other ideas: I have a few more ideas, but first I would like to start with the ones already mentioned here.

This should be a collaborative project that should be interesting for other developers to join, at any point, either because they want to learn about how we have done it (beginners) or propose new ideas (experienced).
