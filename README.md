# JHipsterGroup
Join us, in this Jhipster's developers group, to exercise and learn JHipster with real examples.

Hello,

a bit about this idea:

- If you are new to JHipster and you understand it, but haven't done any real project with it, but you would like to, or ...

- If you want to practice a little and you want to see what can you do with it after hello world and small examples, or ...

- If you want to develop an app with a group of people and share it afterwards, or ...

- If you just want to help us ....



I would like to create a newspaper (that should end up looking something like this: http://ganiev.me/preview/unify-v2.5.1/multipage/blog-magazine/classic/bm-classic-home-page-1.html), and then add a social site (similar to this: http://ganiev.me/preview/unify-v2.5.1/unify-main/pages/page-profile-main-1.html) and some other ideas, while we learn JHipster at the same time with a real example. It should be real live app, looking professional and be more complex than course examples.



I can try it alone and I got to the point of running the app at Heroku:

https://gradlempty.herokuapp.com/#/

... but I think we can learn more if we do more complicated things together! This great books: The JHipster Mini-Book 4.5 by Matt Raible  https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/jhipster-4x-mini-book and Full Stack Development with JHipster can take you to Heroku, even if you are not an expert, but I would like to go beyond that.

If we can create a group of live examples (https://github.com/Tonterias/JHipsterGroup/blob/master/app.md) that shows how to do what everybody is asking, time and again: Matt Raible, Jon Ruddell, GaÃ«l Marziou and all the great guys that are helping us (in Gitter or StackOverflow), it will be a success!!!

So if you want to share your problems and solutions with others, contact me in GitHub or send me an email (raroraroraro2018@gmail.com). We will start soon (with some drafts) to end with a JDL file similar to the attached: https://github.com/Tonterias/JHipsterGroup/blob/master/jhipster-jdl.jh
